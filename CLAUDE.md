# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

nihongo.lv — a Japanese language learning web application for Latvian speakers. Rewrite of an older Express/EJS app (old code in `../nihongo.lv-old` for reference).

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router, React)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Database:** PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- **Auth:** Auth.js (Google OAuth)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **CJK Fonts:** Noto Sans/Serif JP/SC/TC/KR via `next/font/google` (self-hosted, unicode-range subsetted)
- **Data tables:** TanStack Table v8 with manual sorting/pagination; nuqs for URL state
- **TTS:** AWS Polly via AWS SDK v3
- **Kanji stroke input:** @kaspars/kaku and @kaspars/kaku-ren (author's own npm packages)
- **Hosting:** Self-hosted — Docker, nginx reverse proxy

## Features

### Core (priority)
- **Dictionary:** Japanese-Latvian dictionary with search, furigana rendering, TTS audio
- **Kanji database:** Kanji with properties (keyword, meanings, readings, grade, JLPT, strokes, etc.), filtering, daily kanji
- **Kanji drills:** Heisig-style keyword↔kanji association. Users learn unique Latvian keywords for each kanji. Stroke writing input via @kaspars/kaku-ren evaluates acquisition level. Inspired by Kanji Dojo (https://github.com/syt0r/Kanji-Dojo)
- **User accounts:** Google OAuth, progress tracking per user

### Secondary
- **Widgets:** Weather (multiple cities), EUR exchange rates, Riga/Tokyo time
- **Static pages:** Lightweight, for informational content when needed
- **Admin UI:** Internal character browser at `/admin/characters` — filterable/sortable data grid with context switcher (All / Japanese / Chinese Simplified / Chinese Traditional). Context drives visible columns, filter options, and API scoping.

### Future ideas
- **Duolingo-style drills:** Vocabulary, sentence patterns — game-like learning environment
- **3D learning spaces:** Spatial memory / mind palace approach to kanji learning. First-person exploration of 3D environments with kanji placed in space. Tech: React Three Fiber (r3f) + Drei
- **Data migration:** Selective migration from old PostgreSQL database (different schema)

### Long-term vision: Multi-language CJK platform
- Chinese characters (hanzi) are the shared foundation across Japanese, Mandarin, Cantonese, Korean
- Sino-Japanese (on'yomi), Sino-Korean, and Mandarin readings share systematic etymological/phonetic parallels (e.g., 図書館: toshokan / túshūguǎn / doseogwan)
- **Data model:** Design schema to be language-aware from the start — base character table with shared properties, language-specific reading/vocabulary tables referencing it. Base table includes all forms: kanji (shinjitai/kyūjitai), hanzi (simplified + traditional), hanja. A relationship table cross-references corresponding forms (many-to-many, since e.g. one simplified Chinese form can map to multiple traditional forms). Relationship types: traditional↔simplified, shinjitai↔kyūjitai, etc.
- **UI:** Japanese-first, but users can optionally see Mandarin/Korean/Cantonese cross-references
- **Future:** Fork the project for dedicated Mandarin/Korean apps reusing the same character database and codebase
- **Discipline:** Don't over-generalize prematurely. Build Japanese-first, but avoid hardcoding Japanese assumptions into table structures

### Discarded from old app
- Blog system, comments, image library/Unsplash integration

## Furigana Markup

Storage format inherited from old app: `kanji{furigana}[normalized]` (e.g., `食{た}べる`). Compact and human-readable. Rendered to HTML `<ruby>` tags at the view layer. The `[normalized]` part's necessity is under review. Parser must have solid test coverage (old tests in `../nihongo.lv-old/test/formattingHelpers_test.js`).

## Testing

High test coverage (~90%) is a hard requirement. Tests must not be an afterthought.

- **Framework:** Vitest (fast, native TypeScript/ESM)
- **Component testing:** React Testing Library
- **DB tests:** Run against a real test PostgreSQL database, not mocks
- **E2E:** Playwright (later, not initial priority)

### Principles
- Extract logic into pure functions and test them independently. Keep React components thin.
- Every module should be testable. If it's hard to test, refactor the design.
- Write tests alongside implementation, not after.

## Local Development Setup

1. `nvm use` — Use the pinned Node version (see `.nvmrc`)
2. `npm install`
3. `cp .env.example .env.local` — Fill in secrets (Google OAuth, AWS, etc.)
4. `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d` — Start PostgreSQL (port 5433)
5. `npm run db:migrate` — Apply migrations
6. `npm run dev` — Start Next.js dev server with hot reload

PostgreSQL runs in Docker; the app runs natively for full hot reload. The dev DB uses port **5433** to avoid conflicts with any local PostgreSQL on 5432.

To stop the dev DB: `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down`

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — Start dev server (Turbopack)
- `npm run build` — Production build
- `npm run start` — Start production server
- `npm run lint` — ESLint
- `npm test` — Run all tests (Vitest)
- `npm run test:watch` — Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run db:generate` — Generate Drizzle migrations from schema changes
- `npm run db:migrate` — Apply migrations to database
- `npm run db:studio` — Open Drizzle Studio (DB browser)

## CJK Font Conventions

Font classes and matching `lang` attributes must be applied together — the font provides the glyphs, the `lang` attribute activates the OpenType `locl` feature for Han-unified code points (same codepoint, different canonical glyph per language).

- Japanese: `class="font-cjk-ja-sans"` + `lang="ja"`
- Simplified Chinese: `class="font-cjk-zhs-sans"` + `lang="zh-Hans"`
- Traditional Chinese: `class="font-cjk-zht-sans"` + `lang="zh-Hant"`
- Korean: `class="font-cjk-ko-sans"` + `lang="ko"`
- Serif variants available: `font-cjk-ja-serif` etc. — use for learning cards and literary reader.

**`next/font` restriction:** font calls require literal object arguments — no spread operators. All options must be written out explicitly in each call, or the build will fail with "Unexpected spread".

## Old Codebase Reference

The previous implementation is at `../nihongo.lv-old`. Key files for reference:
- `server.js` — monolithic Express app (1,246 lines)
- `libs/formattingHelpers.js` — furigana markup parser (worth porting logic + tests)
- `libs/dictionarySearch.js` — dictionary search with type detection and ranking
- `models/` — Sequelize models (kanji, word, sentence, user, etc.)
- `test/` — Mocha/Chai tests for formatting and validation helpers
